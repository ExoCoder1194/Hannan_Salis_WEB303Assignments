        <div class="content">
            <p>Albert Einstein was born in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire on 14 March 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.</p>

            <p>Albert Einstein is best known for his theory of relativity, particularly his equation, E=mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>

    <div class="tab-content" data-content="1">Einstein married Mileva Marić in 1903. The couple had three children: Lieserl, Hans Albert, and Eduard. They divorced in 1919, after which Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal in the same year. He lived with Elsa until her death in 1936.</div>
    <div class="tab-content" data-content="2">E=mc^2 is the energy-mass equivalence formula, which states that energy and mass are interchangeable. It's one of the foundational pillars of modern physics.</div>
    <div class="tab-content" data-content="3">General Relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field are physically identical.</div>
    <div class="tab-content" data-content="4">In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon observed when certain metals emit electrons upon exposure to light.</div>
    <div class="tab-content" data-content="5">Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors. His distinctive appearance and personality have left an enduring mark on popular culture.</div>
